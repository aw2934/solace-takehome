# Getting Started

Pull down the project, and run `npm run install:dev` to install dependencies. (This command will install both client and server dependencies.)

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory, and add `POSTGRES_SECRET` to enable connection to the database.

Run `npm run dev` to launch the app. This command will launch both the client and the server.

# Missing Pieces

This app should satisfy all requirements specified on Notion. Given more time, however, there are a few UX features I would implement:

1. Loading states anytime we have an asynchronous API call
2. Error handling, on both the client and the server
3. Much better design, including responsive design
4. Confirmation modal before note deletion

Additionally, it would probably make sense to put the frontend and the backend in separate repos.
